# INTRODUCTION
PHP Bootstrap code implies making a bootstrapper that handles all the dynamic requests made to a server and apply the MVC system so that in future you can change the functionality for each unique application or component without changing the whole. Bootstrap help you to design websites faster and easier, includinging HTML and CSS based design templates.

PHP Bootstrap templates make it less complicated for clients to construct complex and compelling web apps. PHP requires a local server to run PHP code. Designers using Bootstrap with PHP and PHP Hosting can enjoy all these benefits.

Around 18 million websites were using the Bootstrap framework by the end of the year 2018. An increasing number of websites have begun utilizing the framework in 2019, and the numbers have been rising since then. In reality, Bootstrap has become the foremost loved choice of engineers when building compelling web applications.

A PHP dashboard is a single or multi-tab visualization tool that can be integrated within PHP projects. Usually, these are browser-based applications that are built as a customizable component of larger projects. A PHP dashboard is designed to accept raw data from other components of the projects and then present it in various formats. These dashboards are generally built using JS because of great (and smooth) integration between PHP and JavaScript.

That’s why in this tutorial, I will use Bootstrap for demonstrating the idea of PHP dashboards.

# Overview of Admin Dashboard----
It’s a web-based interface allowing admins or authorized users to manage and monitor different aspects of a web app. It provides an overview of key metrics, such as user traffic, sales, or website performance, and enables administrators to access and control features and settings unavailable to regular users.

Some of the common functions of an admin dashboard include:

Admin dashboards typically allow administrators to manage user accounts, including creating new accounts, modifying user information, and deleting accounts.
Admin dashboards can provide tools for managing website content.
Admin dashboards may include analytics tools to track website metrics, such as page views, unique visitors, bounce rates, and conversion rates.
Admin dashboards may provide customization options to modify the website’s design or functionality.
Using PHP With Bootstrap 5
Bootstrap is a front-end framework that provides a set of pre-built CSS and JavaScript components for creating responsive and mobile-first web pages, while PHP is a server-side scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages.

Bootstrap can be used with PHP to build dynamic web pages by integrating PHP code with HTML and Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript components. Bootstrap and PHP can be used together to create dynamic, responsive websites with great user experience.

You can use PHP to handle server-side processing and database and Bootstrap to handle the presentation layer and user interface. You must include Bootstrap’s CSS and JavaScript files and use the appropriate Bootstrap classes and components in your code.

Requirements for PHP and Bootstrap
Before you start using PHP with Bootstrap, you must ensure that your system meets the following requirements:   

PHP v8.0 or later
MariaDB v 10.x
Bootstrap v5.0 or late




# SUMMARY
Creating a PHP admin dashboard with Bootstrap 5 is an excellent way to streamline your web development workflow and enhance the user experience of your applications. However, the design decisions you make can have a significant impact on the performance, maintainability, and scalability of your dashboard.

By continuously learning and improving your techniques, you can stay ahead of the curve and deliver innovative, high-quality solutions that exceed your users’ expectations. So, roll up your sleeves and start coding an awesome PHP admin dashboard with Bootstrap 5!

This application can also be implemented using an API where you don’t have to mix HTML and PHP code. The data will be added or retrieved from the database using the API.
